# How to setup GoAnimate 2014
Hello! If you came here from the GoAnimate 2014 website, please read this on how to setup GoAnimate 2014.
To start GoAnimate 2014 on Windows, you're first gonna need to install some programs:
  - Node.JS (download [here](https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.2.0/node-v20.2.0-x64.msi))
  - Ungoogled Chromium (download [here](https://github.com/Wyse-/ungoogled-chromium-binaries/releases/download/67.0.3396.87-3/ungoogled-chromium_67.0.3396.87-3_windows.zip))

  After installing these programs, extract Ungoogled Chromium using WINRAR. Finally, open launch_goanimate.bat. It'll automate just about everything for you and, well, start GoAnimate 2014. After that, head to Chromium, run chrome.exe and navigate to http://localhost:4343/. **Currently there is no support for Linux, MacOS support is currently in development and will be released soon.**
